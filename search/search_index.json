A pattern in <code>.opaf</code> format requires packaging before it can be distributed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Package - <code>.opafpkg</code> files are packaged, self-contained patterns which can be distributed by the designer. These files can be used to generate projects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Project - <code>.opafproj</code> files are generated from packaged pattern files based on individual user configuration. An <code>.opafproj</code> file can be used with any compatible reader and is stand-alone so does not depend on the original pattern file. Project tracking is also integral.</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
